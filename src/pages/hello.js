        <h2>I grew up on the Monterey Peninsula in California just north of Big Sur, which spurred my love of hiking, running, kayaking, and the outdoors. I’ve been furthering this love through directing a women’s outdoors club at UW for the past few years - ask me about it! I love to talk about sustainability and initiatives to get people outside.</h2>
